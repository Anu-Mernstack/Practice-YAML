  <p>Learning YAML
  Why YAML is Important for Developers:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, and Pulumi use YAML (or JSON) to define infrastructure.

CI/CD Pipelines Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure Pipelines, and CircleCI use YAML to define workflows. Example: .github/workflows/deploy.yml

Kubernetes Configuration YAML is the standard for writing Kubernetes manifests (pods, deployments, services, etc.).

Configuration Files Many tools and frameworks use YAML for settings: docker-compose.yml application.yml in Spring Boot ansible-playbook.yml helm charts

Readable and Easy to Maintain YAML is human-readable, making it ideal for configuration over more verbose alternatives like XML or JSON.</p>
